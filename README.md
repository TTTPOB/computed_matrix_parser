# A Package Reads deepTools computeMatrix output (WIP)
I dont have the time to write documents yet, if you need any you have to look at the code, it is extremely simple.

# Note for Chinese users
if you have trouble installing this package using `devtools::install_github("TTTPOB/dtcmparser")`, use `devtools::install_git("https://hub.fastgit.org/TTTPOB/dtcmparser.git")` instead. (Many thanks to [fastgit](https://www.fastgit.org) for this great service.)
